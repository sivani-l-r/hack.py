# hack.py

This repository contains the projects built during the hack.py event conducted by GDSC MBCET.

## Projects

### Day 1 - Simple Calculator

Built a simple calculator using Python programming language.

### Day 2 - Random Number Generator API

Built an API using Python that generates a random number within a user-defined range. 

#### Usage

You can access the API by sending a GET request to `[yourdomain.com/gen?min=1&max=5](http://yourdomain.com/gen?min=1&max=5)` (replace `yourdomain.com` with your domain). The API generates a random number between `min` and `max` (inclusive).

### Day 3 - Login Window using Tkinter

Built a login window using Tkinter with two input fields that take in a username and password. 

The program displays a message box with "Login successful" if the variables match. Otherwise, it displays an error message.

### Day 4 - API Response Display

Used the https://anapioficeandfire.com API to get the details of the first House of Westeros and printed the name, region, and coat of arms from the API response.
